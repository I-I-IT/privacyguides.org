Since the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in December 2022, talking with Largue Language Models (LLMs) has become common. It can help us write better, understand unfamiliar subjects or answer a wide range of questions. However, the developpers of those models need data to improve their model. Unfortunately, this include your conversations with the AI.

## Recommended Providers

The recommendations here do not train their models using your chats, do not retain your chats for more than 30 days, and are accessible privately. However, you should not submit sensitive PII to an online provider.
